# ZZRRT Project

This repository contains the codebase for my project named 'ZZRRT', in which users can enjoy 'This or That' tournament-style choice games. I'll update further information in detail as this repository is contributed.

## Meaning of ZZRRT

In Korean language, the sound of being electrically shocked is transcribed as '찌리릿'(Jjiririt) -- 'Zap' being the most similar onomatopoeia in English. I created the name by replacing 'J's with 'Z's to emphasize and omitted redundant vowels for a more impactful presentation.
